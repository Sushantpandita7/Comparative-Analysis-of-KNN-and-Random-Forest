The data presents the loan status of various individuals along with their loan amounts, term, interest rate, grade, employment length, 
home ownership status and annual income.
The data processing requires that dummy variables are produced for a few factors.
Running the Random Forest model requires arrays of features and labels and we tune the model on parameters to produce minimum RMSE.
We run the KNN model and optimize the number of neighbours using a a plot.
The models produce similar results however, KNN produced a better RMSE by a small margin.
